Head to Head Game

This is an app where you can rank any random variable you want. 
Want to rank your top 20 songs? This game uses the Elo Rating system to rank variables based on multiple head to head matchups.

The app uses the implemented Elo system created at this repo: https://github.com/HankSheehan/EloPy

The game uses Python and saves the game state in a CSV file after each instance of play.
